# Fourier Transformations on ECG readings

This repository contains code for performing Fourier analysis on ECG signals. The code utilizes Python and libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib to process and visualize the Fourier transform of ECG data.
Features

    ECG Signal Processing: The code reads ECG data from a CSV file and performs necessary preprocessing steps.
    Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): It applies the FFT algorithm to obtain the frequency domain representation of the ECG signal.
    Visualization: The code provides visualizations of the ECG signal in the time domain and the corresponding FFT spectrum.
    Abnormality Detection: It includes functionality to classify ECG signals as normal or abnormal based on the provided labels.

Usage

The main code file, main.py, contains the necessary functions to process and analyze the ECG signals. Customize the code as per your requirements, such as modifying the data file path, adjusting preprocessing steps, or enhancing the visualization options.
